# Personal-Assistant-using-Python-and-ChatGPT-Prompt-Engineering

## Overview
The Personal Assistant is an AI-based application that utilizes ChatGPT prompt engineering to create a virtual assistant capable of understanding and responding to user queries. 
This project demonstrates the power of OpenAI's ChatGPT model, allowing users to interact with a conversational AI to get answers to various questions and perform tasks.

## Features
**Customizable Prompts:** Easily customize prompts to shape the behavior and responses of the personal assistant (eg. Finance Expert, real Estate Assistant etc).

**Conversational Interaction:** Engage in natural language conversations with the AI-powered personal assistant.

**Query Handling:** Ask the assistant questions on a wide range of topics, including general knowledge, health care, financial information, and more.

**Informations:** The personal assistant provids helpful information.

**Friendly User Interface:** The user-friendly interface makes it simple for users to interact with the assistant.

## How to Use
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Install the required dependencies.
* Obtain your OpenAI **GPT-3.5 Turbo** API key and replace YOUR_API_KEY in the code with your actual API key.
* Run the application.
* The Personal Assistant will start, and you can interact with it.

## Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering is a powerful technique that enables users to shape the behavior and output of AI models. 
By strategically designing prompts, users can guide models to produce accurate, relevant, and context-aware responses for various tasks.
